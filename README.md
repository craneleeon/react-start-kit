## react-start-kit
A Node project template with basic folder structure and files includes Grunt tasks &  package.json to start a React web app development. 

## Folder structure
```
 +/  (project root)
   + /serv (server-side app folder)
       -- (all server side js stays here)
    + /public (static/ built client-side  assets) 
    + /dist (final output package for deploying, includes server & webapp with minimized assets)
    + /web (src client-side js/css)
       â€”-(all other assets like html & imgs stay here)
       + /js (web js)
         -- app.js (webapp main entry, since browserify will build this into bundle.app.js, new entries should be added into ./grunt/browserify.js)
    + /css (web css)
    + /build (output files for development debug)
    + /dist  (final output minified files for deploy )
