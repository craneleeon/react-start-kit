## react-start-kit
A Node project template with basic folder structure and files includes Grunt tasks &  package.json to start a React web app development.  [browserify](http://browserify.org) with [reactify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactify) used to compile js components. 

## Folder structure
```
 +/  (project root)
    -- (all server-side js stays here)
    + /public (static/ built client-side  assets) 
    + /dist (final output package for deploying, includes server & webapp with minimized assets)
    + /web (client-side js, css, assets)
       â€”-(all other assets like html & imgs stay here)
       + /app (js files uses in this web app, such as React components, and all these will be compiled into to public/js as browser js)
         -- app.js (webapp main entry, browserify will build this into bundle.app.js, new entries should be added into ./grunt/browserify.js)
       + /js (vender's js goes here will be copied to "public/js" and ignored by browserify)
       + /css (css files, be copied to "public/css"  )
       + /less (".less" files will be compiled to "public/css" end with ".css")
    + /build (output files for development debug)
    + /dist  (final output minified files for deploy )
```
